# 8 Week SQL Challenge

Welcome to my **8 Week SQL Challenge** repository! This challenge is part of the [Data With Danny](https://datawithdanny.com/) virtual data apprenticeship program, celebrating the launch of the Serious SQL course. My goal is to document my learning journey in SQL, build a robust personal portfolio, and share my progress with the community.

## What is the 8 Week SQL Challenge?

The 8 Week SQL Challenge is an initiative designed to help data professionals, particularly those new to SQL, to:

- Dedicate consistent time to learning SQL.
- Build and share a personal project portfolio on GitHub.
- Develop a strong online presence by regularly posting updates on social media.

This challenge is an opportunity to immerse yourself in SQL, enhance your skills, and connect with a community of like-minded individuals.

## How This Repository is Organized

This repository will be organized by weeks and case studies. Each week, I will focus on a different case study, and the work for each case study will be housed in its respective folder.

### Case Studies

Here are the case studies I will be working on throughout the challenge:

1. **Danny’s Diner**
2. **Pizza Runner**
3. **Foodie-Fi**
4. **Data Bank**
5. **Data Mart**
6. **Clique Bait**
7. **Balanced Tree Clothing Co.**
8. **Fresh Segments**

Each folder will contain the following:

- **SQL Queries:** The SQL scripts used to solve the case study problems.
- **Analysis:** A detailed explanation of my approach and insights gained from the analysis.
- **Visualizations:** Any visual representations of the data where applicable.
- **Learnings:** Key takeaways and learnings from each case study.

## Challenge Timeline

The beauty of this challenge is its flexibility – there’s no official start or end date. You can start and finish whenever you want, and the 8-week period is simply a guideline.

I plan to approach the challenge as follows:

- **Week 1-2:** Case Study #1 - Danny’s Diner
